    "LEGO's claim to fame goes well beyond its famous interlocking plastic bricks: the company diversified into movies, video games, TV shows, social channels and theme parks, helping it grow even through the COVID-19 pandemic.",
    "ContactPigeon reports LEGO sales rose 14% in the first half of 2020 vs. H1 2019, with operating profit up 11% to $622 million.",
    "LEGO's marketing strategy blends a durable core brand identity (creative, safe, educational play) with modern digitalization and data-driven customer understanding.",
    "The article breaks LEGO's approach into six key factors: focused market entry (e.g., China), licensing & merchandising (franchise tie-ins, movies, LEGOLAND), social media and content marketing, an integrated experience that generates UGC (LEGO Life, LEGO Ideas), education partnerships (LEGO Education, LEGO Foundation grants), and a "parent-approved" positioning emphasizing safety and learning value.",
    "ContactPigeon evaluates LEGO's eCommerce UX (category pages, product pages, checkout) and suggests optimizations; they propose one quick test — an exit-intent pop-up — which their data suggests could recover ~1% of revenue (they run a worked example using article-cited revenue figures).",
    "The article lists several impressive LEGO statistics (seven sets sold every second in some regions; ~1300 LEGO pieces produced per second; ~400 billion LEGO bricks in the world; consumers spend nearly 5 billion hours/year with LEGO products).",
    "Conclusion: LEGO's mix of innovation, diversification and consistent brand investments enables resilience and long-term growth; the piece encourages marketers to combine stable brand foundations with selective modern tactics."
