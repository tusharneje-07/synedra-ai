    "LEGO's marketing strategy seamlessly integrates nostalgia, community engagement, and strategic partnerships to maintain its position as a leading brand in the toy industry.",
    "The LEGO brand was first established in 1932 in Billund, Denmark, founded by Ole Kirk Kristiansen. LEGO shifted from wooden toys to plastic bricks and introduced the interlocking design that became foundational to the product line.",
    "LEGO has long maintained core values around quality, creativity and play; the company codified product guidelines (the '10 LEGO characteristics') to ensure consistency across products and communications.",
    "Key marketing tactics include nostalgia-driven campaigns, themed franchise collaborations (Star Wars, Harry Potter, Marvel, etc.), community-driven initiatives (LEGO Ideas), and digital/interactive play including video games and AR apps.",
    "LEGO leverages strategic partnerships and educational/STEAM programs to expand into new audiences such as educators and parents, and to position products as learning tools.",
    "LEGO stores act as immersive brand experiences with free play areas, exclusive launches, Pick a Brick walls, and events that drive community engagement and brand loyalty.",
    "Sustainability is an increasing part of LEGO’s positioning: commitments to sustainable materials, recyclable packaging, and partnerships like WWF are highlighted as long-term priorities.",
    "Results cited in the piece include strong brand value and financial growth (LEGO named most valuable toy brand in 2024 with brand value near $8B), and continued market share growth in the first half of 2024 attributed in part to partnerships and product expansions."
