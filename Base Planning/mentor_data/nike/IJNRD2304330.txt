Abstract:
In-depth analysis of Nike's rise to the top of its industry and how other businesses
have attempted to imitate its formula for success are provided in this essay. The
company's distinctive marketing approach and culture, which greatly promotes
innovation and creativity, are at the core of Nike's business plan. I'll start by giving a
quick overview of the business and its most well-known brand. Then, a thorough
study of these two crucial success factors will be given. The following section of the
essay will concentrate on how other businesses in the same industry and other
industries have applied comparable techniques in an effort to increase their own
earnings and goods.

relationship between the Nike emblem, which is fairly recognisable, and the
catchphrase "Just Do It," which has been used in commercials for quite some time,
has helped to maintain the brand image. The business is recognised for spending a
lot on advertising and brand promotion.

History of Nike: Nike marketing strategies
Currently, Nike is the biggest marketer and reseller of athletic footwear, clothing,
and accessories worldwide. A track and field athlete from the University of Oregon
named Phillip Knight and his coach, Bill Bowerman, launched the business in 1964.
Formerly known as Blue Ribbon Sports, the business made money as a distributor
for the Japanese shoemaker Onitsuka Tiger while also creating its own line of track
shoes (Referenceforbusiness.com, 2014). In order to develop the designs of the Blue
Ribbon Sports prototype shoes, Bowerman collaborated with runners who had long
experimented with modified running shoes for his squad. The concept of innovation
in shoe design would eventually become the cornerstone for the business's future
growth and success. The partnership between Blue Ribbon Sports and Onitsuka
Tiger had all but ended by 1970. Phillip Knight severed ties with the Japanese firm
because he believed it was limiting Blue Ribbon Sport's capacity to expand and
thrive financially in the US. A year later, the business chose to change its name to
"Nike" and introduced its first range of exclusive shoes. Greek mythology provided
the inspiration for the name Nike, which is also the name of the goddess of triumph.
The famous "swoosh" trademark was developed by Caroline Davidson in 1971 for a
charge of $35. For the 1972 U.S. Track and Field Olympic Trials the next year,
Nike actively promoted its products with the help of its brand-new swoosh
trademark (Referenceforbusiness.com, 2014).
Nike's success has been largely attributed to the notion of creating marketing
campaigns that focused on associating Nike's name with the rising careers of young,
well-known athletes (Flynn, 2014). In its first year of distribution, the new Nike
brand brought in roughly two million dollars in income, which was a fantastic
beginning. The company's sales revenue more than quadrupled in two years, and it
was able to secure the endorsement of its first well-known athletes, tennis players
Jimmy Connors and Ilie Nastase.

BACKGROUND:
Expanding its exposure, brand recognition, and appeal was something Nike was
beginning to achieve. Due to its brilliant marketing and expansion techniques, the
company truly began to prosper. It even entered into international markets in Asia
and South Korea, and by 1978, the corporation's sales had reached twenty-eight
million. In 1980, Nike had already raised $269 million in sales and offered more

                                            2023 IJNRD | Volume 8, Issue 4 April 2023 | ISSN: 2456-4184 | IJNRD.ORG
than three million common shares to the public (Referenceforbusiness.com, 2014).
Over sixty Olympians were chosen by Nike to represent them in 1984, and they went
on to win a total of 65 medals. Since this was the first time Nike had been recognised
on a global scale, international sales soared, causing total income to exceed $918.4
million. The following year, Nike made the best choice in the short history of the
business when it signed an endorsement agreement with Michael Jeffrey Jordan,
who would go on to become probably the greatest basketball player of all time.
Jordan was Nike's largest asset (Referenceforbusiness.com, 2014). The company's
prosperity was propelled by this for many years to come. Nike was the first
corporation in the world to earn more than $3 billion in sales by 1991. Early on,
Nike came to the conclusion that supporting the participating athletes and teams was
more crucial than supporting the competition itself. Nike continued this momentum
after its early success with athletes, particularly with Michael Jordan, to sign the best
athletes in the world across many different sports. Due to its continuous dominance
in the sports apparel market, the company today has the biggest market share of any
business. Nike expects to generate around
$30 billion in revenue in 2015, with an anticipated 25% return on its initial
investment (Nike.com, 2014). The company's emphasis or objective is to have the
most inventive and well-known brand on the market, and what better way to do this
than by making significant investments in R&D and endorsing the most well-known
figures in the world? (Flynn, 2014).

Air Jordan:
By agreeing to an endorsement arrangement with Michael Jordan in the middle of
the 1980s, Nike made a wise financial move that gave rise to the Air Jordan brand.
Michael became one of the best athletes because to his career accomplishments,
which included numerous individual and team awards. His brand became the most
well-known on the market as a result. Fans would watch him play and aspire to "be
like Mike," and they would do practically anything to own merchandise bearing his
name. His Jordan brand revolutionised the sneaker market and had the biggest effect.
For instance, practically all styles of sneakers were white prior to the introduction of
Air Jordan. Because he would don his iconic sneakers in violation of National
Basketball Association (NBA) rules during a specific season, Michael was actually
punished many times (Danforth, 2014). Because consumers believed that wearing
Air Jordan products would somehow make them stronger, quicker, or better jumpers,
the company initially marketed itself as a performance brand. Nike was able to
advertise to its target market of consumer athletes thanks to this positioning strategy.
Nike was able to drastically raise its prices and lower production volumes in the
early 2000s as the Jordan market grew even larger. Jordans were consequently
classified as a "luxury good." For instance, the $225 Air Yeezys (Kanye West-
   IJNRD2304330      International Journal of Novel Research and Development (www.ijnrd.org)        d217
                                            2023 IJNRD | Volume 8, Issue 4 April 2023 | ISSN: 2456-4184 | IJNRD.ORG
endorsed Jordan sneakers) have a resale value of almost $1000. (Howenstein, 2014).
Due to the Jordan brand's popularity and high resale value, a whole segment of the
world's population has been dubbed "sneaker heads," who are notorious for
purchasing and collecting these pricey sneakers. These things were bought by
customers as a flamboyant declaration of their financial position. When Nike
releases its Jordan sneakers, it always makes sure to upgrade or add at least one
feature. For instance, the first shoe to feature Nike "Air cushioning" in the heel was
the original Jordan 1, and the Jordan 2s introduced full-length Nike "Air cushioning"
the following year. Jordan Brand carries on Nike's legacy of producing cutting-edge
footwear and clothing "by the athlete for the
athlete" (Downs, 2013). Because of the absurdly long lineups and "die- hard" brand
loyalty, Nike releases a new sneaker every year, and the release is frequently
highlighted on various news programming platforms (Sneakernews.com, 2013).
Two other Nike sneaker lines, the Air Forces and the Air Flights, were eventually
introduced as a result of the popularity and design of Air Jordan. As a result of the
Jordan brand, Nike was able to stand out from the rest of its rivals in the 1980s and
has continued to have the largest share of the sports footwear and apparel market.
This brand "continues to drive and influence the sports footwear industry into the
future" and "embodies all the essential ideals that Nike conveys"
(Sneakernews.com, 2013).

NIKE’s Marketing strategies:

  1. Market Segmentation
The majority of Nike's customers are athletes or people planning to engage in
physical exercise of some kind, such as a lengthy walk or a football game. Because
of the items' utility, this is the situation. By entering into sponsorship deals with
athletic teams and then promoting their products to the athletes on these teams, Nike
aims to reach these consumers. By doing this, Nike can connect with a large
audience of customers as well as customers who are more inclined to make a
purchase. Nike pays close attention to targeting the athlete more than any other
group of people since they see them as the trendsetters, even though other people
are likely to purchase the products.


  2.       Pricing Strategies

Since these consumers appreciate product intimacy and don't worry as much about
the goods, Nike is already known to target them. Because of this, Nike is able to
charge somewhat more than its rivals. To increase the perceived worth of the
   IJNRD2304330      International Journal of Novel Research and Development (www.ijnrd.org)        d218
                                            2023 IJNRD | Volume 8, Issue 4 April 2023 | ISSN: 2456-4184 | IJNRD.ORG
product, this method advocates for higher pricing points. It is well known that
customers who believe a product to be of good quality are more inclined to
consistently and frequently pay a higher price. Consumers who become intimate
with a product begin to link it with themselves and will pay whatever price is listed
as long as the product bears the Nike emblem. The fact that Nike employs the
vertical integration pricing strategy, whereby they assume ownership of the
participants at various channel levels and engage in a variety of channel-level
operations in an effort to control costs and thereby influence pricing function, is
another very significant point to be made.


  3.       Promotional and Communication Strategies
In addition to offering high-quality items that must result in a high level of consumer
loyalty, Nike also uses excellent advertising tactics. A number of professional and
famous athletes that Nike has worked with have been able to generate a lot of
interest in their merchandise. Football (or soccer) legends Ronaldinho, Ronaldo, and
Roberto Carlos are just a few of the athletes Nike has signed. Other athletes include
basketball players Jermaine O'Neal and Lebron James2, triathlete Gerri Armstrong,
and golfing legend Tiger Woods. This has increased consumer awareness of Nike
products to a fair extent. Nike has used a lot of mass media advertisements in
addition to signing famous athletes to sell their products. Nike has a selective-
demand marketing strategy that concentrates on the expensive shoes worn for
traditional sports. Nike has held onto its position as the leader in the manufacture
and distribution of sporting goods. Nonetheless, it should be highlighted that Nike
cannot "sleep at the top" due to competitive pressure. It will be extremely difficult
to develop new marketing strategies in the wake of the recent Reebok-Adidas
merger. In a scenario where marketing management is proficient, the following
suggestions are offered. These include:
• A rise in market share achieved by the creation of new products, smart pricing
tactics, marketing, and other effective promotional techniques.
• Reorganize market dominance by pushing out rivals, mostly through aggressive
marketing tactics combined with price functions that will make the market very
undesirable for rivals.
 • Greater social responsibility to improve the company's reputation.

 • Diversity of the market by include Asians and Black Americans in product
 promotions and conducting research to determine these groups' preferences.

  • Explore new distribution avenues, especially in global markets

                                            2023 IJNRD | Volume 8, Issue 4 April 2023 | ISSN: 2456-4184 | IJNRD.ORG
  • A different pricing strategy to tap on untapped market opportunities.

  4.       Target Market:

Athletes are primarily the target market for Nike, particularly those who are devoted
to fitness and sports. The business markets its products to customers who wish to
achieve to their highest potential thanks to the development of a brand image that is
linked with athletics. Casual shoppers that appreciate comfort, style, and fashion are
now part of Nike's target demographic.

  5.       Product Innovation and Design:

Nike's success has been largely attributed to the inventiveness and design of their
products. To manufacture products that specifically satisfy the needs of athletes, the
company makes significant investments in research and development. In order to
appeal to a wider clientele than only athletes, Nike has also strived to produce
products that are chic and attractive. The business has produced a number of
legendary items, like the Air Jordan, Air Max, and Flyknit, which are now
commonplace in the sports shoe sector.


  6.Ambassadors and Sponsorships:

By collaborating with renowned athletes and sports organisations all over the world,
Nike has developed a strong brand. High-profile athletes have frequently signed
endorsement contracts with the business, including Michael Jordan, LeBron James,
and Cristiano Ronaldo. The US national basketball team and the Manchester United
football club are only two of the sporting organisations that Nike supports. These
collaborations aid Nike in expanding its market reach and enhancing its reputation as
a company that embodies excellence and athleticism.


  7.       Emotional Branding:

With the development of marketing initiatives that speak to the ideals and goals of
its target audience, Nike has developed an emotional bond with its customers. One
of the most famous marketing catchphrases in history is attributed to the company's
   IJNRD2304330      International Journal of Novel Research and Development (www.ijnrd.org)        d220
                                            2023 IJNRD | Volume 8, Issue 4 April 2023 | ISSN: 2456-4184 | IJNRD.ORG
"Just Do It" campaign, which was introduced in 1988. Inspiring people to act and go
after their aspirations, the campaign embodies the willpower, grit, and tenacity
associated with the Nike brand.


  8.       Digital Marketing and Social Media:
In order to communicate with its customers and reach a larger audience, Nike has
embraced social media and digital marketing. The business has established a
significant online presence, with a website that offers comprehensive product
information and enables online product purchases. Additionally, Nike has active
social media pages on sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram where it posts
content about its merchandise, partnerships, and advertising campaigns.

Research Methodology:
The research we conducted for this research paper is a descriptive study. As a result,
I employed secondary sources of information for my research, including books,
online journals, periodicals, and various publications. Also, we applied several
statistical and fundamental mathematical procedures for data tabulation.
CONS OF NIKE’S CORE MARKETING STRATEGY:
Although Nike's marketing methods have had a lot of beneficial effects on the
business, they will also have negative effects. The assignment's negative effects will
be highlighted by the large costs incurred, the spokesperson's influence, and rivals.


 1. Costly

Nike had to spend a lot on making and promoting its items because it had employed
numerous marketing methods. Handling inventories, designing, promoting, and
production all have rising expenses. 2009's Abhiroopsur Inflation had also increased
the price of transportation and raw supplies. Nike has raised the prices of its goods
while cutting back on marketing expenditures in an effort to address these issues.
As a result, this might hinder Nike's long-term growth. Lautelli (2011) Nike
allegedly used child labour in Cambodia to lower labour and production expenses,
according to Boggan (2001). This had a negative impact on its brand image and may
have caused many consumers to cease supporting Nike and buying its products.
  2. Influences of spokesperson
  Using a team of athletes to advertise their products is one of Nike's main
  marketing methods. Nike wants to use well-known sportsmen as their brand
  ambassadors, such as LeBron James, Michael Jordan, and runner Steve
  Prefontaine. Athletes had both a beneficial and a bad impact on customers'
   IJNRD2304330      International Journal of Novel Research and Development (www.ijnrd.org)        d221
                                              2023 IJNRD | Volume 8, Issue 4 April 2023 | ISSN: 2456-4184 | IJNRD.ORG
   shifting preferences, tastes, and priorities, as well as their purchasing behaviour.
   Nike's chosen spokespersons' behaviour and attitude may have an impact on its
   marketing tactics.
   For instance, if Nike uses a well-known athlete as an ambassador, it will entice the
   player's idolater to buy the merchandise. Conversely, if the player was discovered
   to be a drug addict or to have any other immoral behaviour, it would discourage
   buyers from purchasing Nike goods.
   3. Intense Competitors
Nike deals with a lot of competition. Adidas, Reebok, Puma, and other brands are
their rivals, and since Adidas arrived, the competition has gotten more intense.
Moreover, Nike and Adidas have slightly different product lines. Adidas specialises
in shoes for men, women, and children between the ages of 10 and 30, while Nike
focuses mostly on shoes for men and women between the ages of 15 and 35. This
demonstrated that Nike's marketing strategy is less diverse. To draw more parents as
potential clients, they may also provide children's footwear. Also, Adidas's main
office is in Germany, but it focuses on the European market, in contrast to Nike,
whose distribution strategy is primarily focused on the native market, which is the
United States of America.
Nike should therefore expand the geographic scope of where its products are sold in
order to reach a wider audience and build a stronger brand. In 2000, Allick et al.

SUGGESTIONS:

The following recommendations are suggested in a situation where marketing
management is competent:


     • Nike should expand its market share through the release of new products,
     aggressive pricing strategies, and advertising and promotional campaigns.


     • Nike should also restructure its market dominance by setting itself apart
     from rivals, primarily through aggressive pricing and mass promotion strategies
     that make Nike more alluring to consumers.


     • In addition, Nike needs to raise its awareness of corporate social
     responsibility to improve its reputation.


     • Also, Nike should pay close attention to their R&D division as they
     investigate all types of people with various tastes in order to achieve their
     market diversification objectives.

     • People with various tastes in order to achieve the market diversification
     objectives.
Conclusion:

Because of this, the history of Nike's marketing strategy shows that in order to
successfully launch a product, it is essential in the first place to comprehend what
consumers require. After their needs are identified, a marketing strategy may be
developed using their products to offer every conceivable remedy. For instance, Nike
tried to assist people do this by selling shoes even though they knew that what people
needed was a new technique to keep fit rather than shoes. Also, Nike's marketing
methods emphasise the importance of adding value to every consumer
communication a business engages in, particularly online: if you're not resolving
issues or giving accurate information, your firm won't benefit. If your goal is to make
viewers' daily lives better, then your strategy is invariably flawed. At least on the
surface, marketing isn't just about selling your product: Bill Bowerman didn't build

an empire by selling shoes, but by teaching consumers the art of running, and those
customers responded by buying countless quantities of Nike Moon Shoes and Air
Max.
