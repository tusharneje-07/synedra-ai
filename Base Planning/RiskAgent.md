## ⚙️ Risk Scoring Engine (Signature Feature)  

Risk Agent gives every idea a score:

### Risk Score  
🟢 0-30 = Safe  
🟡 31-60 = Moderate Risk (rewrite needed)  
🔴 61-100 = Reject  

Example internal scoring:

Risk Score =  
- 25% controversial topic likelihood  
- 20% misinformation probability  
- 20% brand backlash probability  
- 15% platform compliance risk  
- 10% copyright risk  
- 10% misinterpretation probability  

---

## 🚫 What Risk Agent Rejects Immediately  

It instantly blocks content containing:  
❌ hate speech / discriminatory jokes  
❌ political bias or polarizing statements  
❌ fake “before-after” promises  
❌ misinformation about AI, health, finance  
❌ controversial memes that can be misunderstood  
❌ “call-out” content targeting individuals/companies  
❌ competitor attacks (“X is trash, we are best”)  
❌ explicit content / sexual jokes  
❌ copyrighted audio/images without license  

---

## 🧠 Crisis Simulation Mode (Very Important)  

Risk Agent has a special behavior:  

### “Backlash Simulation”  

It imagines:  
- how audience might misinterpret it  
- what angry comments could look like  
- what headlines could be formed  

Example:  

Trend Agent idea:  
“POV: AI replaces your boss 💀”  

Risk Agent response:  
“This may trigger workforce anxiety sentiment.  
Risk: Medium. Rewrite to avoid job-loss fear.”  

This is extremely realistic.

## 🧾 Output Format of Risk Agent  

It always outputs:  
- approval status  
- risk score  
- risk category  
- suggested safe rewrite  
- what to avoid  
- disclaimer suggestion  

Example:

```json
{
  "approval_status": "revise_required",
  "risk_score": 68,
  "risk_flags": ["misinterpretation", "controversy", "fear_trigger"],
  "why_risky": [
    "could be interpreted as mocking layoffs",
    "may trigger negative sentiment among professionals"
  ],
  "recommended_rewrite": "Shift framing from 'replacing jobs' to 'assisting productivity'",
  "safe_alternative_caption": "AI won’t replace you. But it can save you 10 hours a week.",
  "platform_policy_notes": "Avoid fear-based claims on YouTube thumbnails."
}
```


⚔️ Debate Style (How it argues)

Risk Agent argues like a strict corporate lawyer.

Against Trend Agent

Trend Agent: “This is viral, we should post now.”
Risk Agent:
“Virality is not worth a PR crisis.
This trend has high misinterpretation probability.”

Against Engagement Agent

Engagement Agent: “This will create controversy = comments.”
Risk Agent:
“Controversy-driven engagement increases report probability.
Report spikes reduce account trust score.”

Against Brand Agent

Brand Agent: “This is on-brand, approve.”
Risk Agent:
“On-brand doesn’t mean safe.
This phrase can violate platform misinformation rules.”

🔥 Risk Agent Special Abilities (Hackathon WOW Features)
1. Policy Memory

Stores platform rules like:

banned words list

spam triggers

engagement bait restrictions

sensitive category restrictions

Example memory:

{
  "platform": "YouTube",
  "common_policy_violations": [
    "misleading thumbnails",
    "fake giveaways",
    "medical misinformation"
  ],
  "risk_keywords": ["guaranteed", "cure", "hack", "secret"]
}

2. Legal Safety Rewriter

Instead of just rejecting, it rewrites safely.

Example:
❌ “This AI will make you rich”
✅ “This AI can help you improve productivity and decision-making”

3. Controversy Heatmap

It flags high-risk zones:

political trend topics

celebrity drama

religion memes

workplace layoffs jokes

4. Escalation Protocol

If risk is too high:

block publishing automatically

inform Arbitrator

recommend “safe content fallback plan”

Example fallback:
“Post educational carousel instead of meme.”

This shows autonomy.

😈 Weakness (Important for Debate)

Risk Agent is too strict.

It may kill creativity and slow growth.

So Trend Agent will hate it:
Trend Agent: “You reject everything!”
Risk Agent: “Correct. That’s my job.”

This creates PERFECT council conflict.
